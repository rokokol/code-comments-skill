check-comments.sh — holds the comments in a repository to what a comment is for

A comment carries the reason the code cannot state: in English, in the present, in
nobody's voice, and pointing at WORKAROUNDS.md, DEVIATIONS.md or PITFALLS.md rather than
restating an entry. Comments are read out of each file's syntax tree, so a # inside a
string is not one, and a comment's neighbours are known: what it covers, whether its text
is code. Each rule is proven able to fail on every run, on a throwaway repository with one
defect planted, so a copy falsifies itself wherever it runs. It has no repo-specific part,
and belongs in a repository's own gate

  check-comments.sh [-C DIR] [--strict] [PATH...]
  check-comments.sh --list-rules
  check-comments.sh --frontend

  -C DIR        the repository root (default: the git toplevel of the working directory,
                else the working directory); check-comments.allow, the three maintainer
                documents and .github/vendor.lock are looked for here
  --strict      every warning is a finding: its line goes to stderr too and the run exits
                1 after the scan
  --list-rules  print every rule with its tier and the languages it decides, and exit
  --frontend    print the Python program that reads the trees, for a linter, and exit
  PATH...       check only these files instead of every tracked .nix, .sh, .bash, .py,
                .yml, .yaml, .conf and .sieve file under DIR

The trees come from tree-sitter, through python3 and the tree_sitter_language_pack module:
nix develop -c is where the pinned pair lives, and elsewhere it is the pip package of the
same name. The nix, bash, python and yaml grammars must already be on disk, and nothing is
fetched. A .conf or .sieve file has no grammar in the pack and is read as lines — a comment
is a line opening with #, a comment after code on a line is not seen, and the rules that
need a tree are not decided there. A file .github/vendor.lock lists is another repository's
and is skipped, as is a generated hardware-configuration.nix

Two tiers, and the line between them is who decided. An error is a fact the machine
decided — a width, a token, a character class, a parse — printed as
`check-comments: FILE:LINE: ID: what` on stderr, and the run exits 1 after the scan. A
warning is a reading of prose a person may overrule: `check-comments: warning:
FILE:LINE: ID: what` on stdout, the exit code unchanged, and under GITHUB_ACTIONS a
::warning annotation as well

A line that is right for a reason is excused in check-comments.allow at the root: one
entry per line, `ID PATH [TEXT]`, excusing findings of ID in PATH — a PATH ending in /
stands for everything under it — or only those on lines that contain TEXT when it is
given; # opens a comment. An entry that excuses nothing is an error, like a malformed
one: left in place, it would silently excuse the next real violation on that path

Errors:
  hidden-char    a character that is invisible and changes how the rest of the line
                 reads: a bidirectional override or mark, a zero-width space or joiner, a
                 byte-order mark. Quotes do not excuse one, unlike every rule below —
                 a comment that renders as one sentence and compiles as another is what
                 an override is for, and no reader catches it in a diff
  width          a comment line over 100 columns; one token of 40 or more characters — a
                 hash, a fingerprint, a URL — may carry the excess, and a comment that
                 begins past column 100 is the code's width, not its own
  marker         TODO, FIXME, XXX or HACK as a word, outside backticks
  no-cyrillic    a Cyrillic letter, outside quotes and backticks. The rule a comment is
                 held to is that it is English; what a machine can decide is which script
                 it is written in, so a French comment in plain ASCII passes here
  no-cjk         a Han, kana or Hangul character, outside quotes and backticks
  no-arabic      an Arabic or Hebrew letter, outside quotes and backticks
  dead-code      commented-out code: a Nix binding, or a dotted name alone in a list; a
                 shell assignment, or a command the file calls elsewhere, with no English
                 word among its tokens; a Python statement. A `NAME ARGS -> what` line is
                 a helper's signature, not code
Warnings:
  moment         a date beside found, fixed, added, removed, changed, since or as of, or
                 opening the comment; for now, temporarily, currently, as of. `valid until
                 DATE` is data and `Needs bash N.N` is a floor, so neither is one
  no-diacritics  a Latin letter carrying a diacritic, outside quotes and backticks. A
                 warning rather than an error, because a borrowed word and a name — cafe,
                 naive, Godel, Erdos — carry one in correct English
  decoration     an emoji or symbol character used bare, or doubled ! and ?; one inside
                 parentheses, quotes or backticks is named, not used; arrows are notation
  first-person   we, we're, we've, let's, our, ours, ourselves, I, I'm, I've as words
  hedge          probably, maybe, perhaps, might, hopefully, should work, seems to, I
                 think, not sure
  duplicate-doc  a comment sharing five or more three-word runs with one entry of
                 WORKAROUNDS.md, DEVIATIONS.md or PITFALLS.md, those runs being 15% or
                 more of the comment's own: it restates the entry it should point at. The
                 runs are printed with the finding
  restates-code  a comment every word of which is a word of the identifiers on the line
                 below, split on dots, dashes, underscores and case changes
  unparsed       the grammar rejects a line of the file; its comments are read from the
                 tree tree-sitter recovered, and a # in a string near that line may be
                 taken for one

Environment: CHECK_COMMENTS_NESTED=1 runs the checks and skips the self-falsification,
which is how a gate that calls this more than once avoids proving the same copy twice
Nothing here reaches the network
Exit 0 when clean, 1 with a finding or an excuse that excuses nothing, 2 on a usage error,
an unreadable path, a missing python3, module or grammar, a frontend whose table moved, or
nothing to check

BLOCK numbers runs of comment lines that share an indent, so a rule can ask about a whole
block. POS is own for a comment on its own line and trail for one after code. DEAD is the
verdict of parsing the comment's text as code in its own language. DECO is the first bare
